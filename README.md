# resume
Basically a simple site that has various Resume templates.

The general idea is that a user has to sign up to the site to be able to create resumes, and how the user will go about creating resumes will be by inputting his/her details in the form provided, and then the user selects the template type, and the site will, using JS and PHP, generate a pdf document that contains the details in the format of the selected template.
